# AI-assistant

This is a virtual assistant written in python language. It takes the input from the user as a text and then performs that particular task for them.
This is just a basic version (v1.0).

At present it perforns operations like :-
1) Browser  2) Editors  3) Media Players  4) Date  5) Time  
6) Calender 7) Wikipedia  8) Instagram  9) WhatsApp  10) Facebook
11) Youtube Search  12) Gmail  13) Calculator  14) MS-Paint  15) Font-Colour 
16) Create Folder  17) Delete Folder  18) Open Folder  19) File Explorer  20) Create Secured Folder  
21) Camera  22) IP-configuration  23) Ping  24) Website  25) WiFi 
26) Hotspot  27) Available Networks  28) Search Apps in Store  29) Weather  30) Songs
31) Set Alarm  32) Python  33) Control-Panel  34) Settings  35) Running Process 
36) Clear Screen  37) LogOut  38) Restart  39) Shut-Down  40) Exit

  This Assistant is smart enough; if it gets two similar apps, then it ask the user, which to open. And accordingly does the task..!
And if it didn't understand, then it takes you to the internet to give you the best possible result.



The next higher version will be released soon...
Stay Tuned..
Thank you
