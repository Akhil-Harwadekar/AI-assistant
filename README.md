# AI-assistant

This is a virtual assistant written in python language. It takes the input from the user as a text and then performs that particular task for them.
This is just a basic version (v1.0).

At present it perforns operations like :-
1) Browser      2) Editors      3) Media Players     4) Date       5) Time 
6) Font-Colour  7) Wikipedia    8) Instagram         9) WhatsApp   10) Facebook
11) Youtube     12) Gmail       13) Control-Panel    14) WiFi      15) Songs 
16) Create Folder  17) Open Folder   18) Python    19) MS-Paint    20) Camera
20) IP-configuration   21) Ping    22) Shut-Down

This Assistant is smart enough; if it gets two similar apps, then it ask the user, which to open. And accordingly does the task..!



The next higher version will be released soon...
Stay Tuned..
Thank you
